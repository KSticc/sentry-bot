#sentry-bot
Wow, a python discord bot that sucks!

If you want to use the bot for yourself for whatever reason:

*Be sure to install discord.py and dotenv
*Make a .env file in the directory with:
    *DISCORD_TOKEN = <your-bot-token> (No <>)
    *DISCORD_PREFIX = <prefix> (No <>)
    *DISCORD_OWNER = <your-id> (No <>)

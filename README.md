#sentry-bot
Wow, a python discord bot that sucks!

If you want to use the bot for yourself for whatever reason:

*Install these libraries:
    discord.py (discord)
    BeautifulSoup (bs4)
    dotenv (python-dotenv)

*Make a .env file in the directory with:
    *DISCORD_TOKEN = your-bot-token
    *DISCORD_PREFIX = your-prefix
    *DISCORD_OWNER = your-discord-id
